#import "counter-main.mligo" "Contract"

// Define your parameter values as a list of LIGO variable definitions
// When this file was created, the smart contract was defined with a main function that was not within a named module. As such, the examples below are written with that assumption in mind.

// If your parameter is a simple value, you can define it directly
// E.g. let default_parameter = 10

// For added type-safety, you can reference the type of your parameter from the contract
// E.g. let default_parameter : Contract.parameter = 10
