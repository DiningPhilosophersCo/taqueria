## Taqueria Installation Basics

Installing Taqueria is a quick and easy process if you understand a few basic concepts and follow the steps outlined in this guide

Taqueria is a software suite that includies the core CLI, a VS Code extension, and a set of plugins

The Taqueria components available for installation are:

- The Taqueria CLI, an executable binary file named `taq` installed globally in your `$PATH` that implements the Taqueria CLI, SDK and protocol
- An optional VS Code plugin 'Taqueria' installed directly through the VS Code Extension Marketplace
- Any number of Taqueria plugins installed n a ***per-project*** basis via the CLI or VS Code Extension

## Requirements

### Taqueria CLI

The requirements for the Taqueria CLI are minimal:

- A unix shell in a compatable operating system:
  - MacOS
  - Linux
  - Windows (via [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 

### Taqueria Plugins

Taqueria plugins may have their own dependencies such as:

  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 
  - [LIGO](https://ligolang.org)
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  - [SmartPY](https://smartpy.io/)

### VS Code Extension

The VS Code Extension requires a recent version of Microsoft Visual Studio Code which can be installed [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Installing the Taqueria CLI

### Overview

Installing the Taqueria CLI involves the following steps:

1. Download the correct build of Taqueria for your operating system to an installation directory of your choice
2. Make the Taqueria binary `taq` executable
3. Ensure your shell's `$PATH` includes the Taqueria installation directory

Once these steps are complete, you will be able to run Taqueria from your terminal using the 'taq' command

Step by step instructions for installing the Taqueria CLI on a Windows, MacOS, or Linux machine are detailed in the following section. If you are comfortable with downloading the unsigned Taqueria binary and configuring it to run in your terminal on your own, you can find the correct build for your local machine [here](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/releases), and then skip to the [Installing Taqueria Plugins Section](#installing-taqueria-pluginsz)

### OS Specific Installation Instructions

To make installation as fast as possible, you can follow the steps detalled below for your particular operating system. Note that these steps are simply one method for installation. You can adjust the particular directories and shell configuration if you feel comfortable doing so

The following steps assume the following terminals on each operating system:

- MacOS: zsh
- Linux: bash
- Windows: bash (via WSL)

<TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS">
  
1. Create a directory to install the Taqueria binary and change into that directory

```shell
mkdir ~/Downloads/taqueria && cd ~/Downloads/taqueria

2. Download the latest MacOS build of Taqueria from the [releases page](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/releases/) and name the binary file 'taq'

```shell
curl -LO https://taqueria.io/get/macos/taq
```

3. Make the binary file executable

```shell
chmod -x taq
```

4. Move the binary to a directory in your shell's `$PATH`

```shell
sudo mv taq /usr/local/bin
````

5. Disable MacOS Gatekeeper to allow Taqueria to run

```shell
sudo spctl --master-disable
```
::: caution

Currently the taq binary is not signed for Mac OS, so in-order to run Taqueria, users must disable MacOS Gatekeeper (This is not ideal). This is a temporary workaround until we can sign the binaries (see [#129](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/issues/129)). 

If you want to re-enable the MacOS Gatekeeper later on, run the command `sudo spctl --master-enable`

## Installing Taqueria Plugins

Taqueria plugins each implement a specific function such as a smart contract language, testnet, sandbox, or test framework. Taqueria plugins often rely on 3rd party software libraries such as LIGO or Docker which need to be installed on your machine for the plugin to work correctly

Taqueria is designed to be flexible, streamlined, and customizable so plugins are installed on a per-project basis depending on the particular smart contract language, test framework, sandbox environment, and testnet used in the project

Once installed, plugins provide their functionality by exposing tasks in the Taqueria CLI. The tasks available to run on a particular project can be viewed by running the `shell taq --help ` command in a project directory that's using Taqueria
