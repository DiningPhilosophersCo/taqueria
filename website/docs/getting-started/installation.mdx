## Taqueria Installation Basics

Installing Taqueria is a quick and easy process if you understand a few basic concepts and follow the steps outlined in this guide

Taqueria is a software suite that includies:

- The Taqueria CLI, an executable binary file named `taq` installed globally in your `$PATH` that implements the Taqueria CLI, SDK and protocol
- A VS Code plugin installed directly through the VS Code Extension Marketplace
- A set of plugins which get installed on a ***per-project*** basis through Taqueria CLI or VS Code Extension

## Requirements

### Taqueria CLI

- A compatable operating system:
  - MacOS
  - Linux
  - Windows (via [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 

### Taqueria Plugins

Taqueria plugins may each have their own dependencies such as:

  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 
  - [LIGO](https://ligolang.org)
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  - [SmartPY](https://smartpy.io/)

### VS Code Extension

The VS Code Extension requires a recent version of Microsoft Visual Studio Code which can be installed [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Installing the Taqueria CLI

### Overview

Installing the Taqueria CLI involves the following steps:

1. Download the correct build of Taqueria for your operating system
2. Make the Taqueria binary `taq` executable
3. Add `taq` to your shell's `$PATH`

Once these steps are complete, you will be able to run Taqueria from your terminal using the `taq` command


### OS Specific Instructions



To make installation as fast as possible, you can follow the steps detalled below for your particular operating system

The following steps assume the following terminals on each operating system:



<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS">
  
1. Download the latest MacOS build of Taqueria

```zsh
cd ~/Downloads && curl -LO https://taqueria.io/get/macos/taq
```

3. Make the binary file executable

```zsh
chmod -x taq
```

4. Move the binary to a directory in your shell's `$PATH`

```zsh
sudo mv taq /usr/local/bin
````

5. Disable MacOS Gatekeeper to allow Taqueria to run

```zsh
sudo spctl --master-disable
```

Currently the taq binary is not signed for Mac OS, so in-order to run Taqueria, users must disable MacOS Gatekeeper (This is not ideal). This is a temporary workaround until we can sign the binaries (see [#129](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/issues/129))

If you want to re-enable the MacOS Gatekeeper later on, run the command `sudo spctl --master-enable`


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="lnx" label="Linux">

1. Download the latest Linux build of Taqueria

```bash
cd ~/Downloads && curl -LO https://taqueria.io/get/linux/taq
```

2. Make the binary file executable

```bash
chmod -x taq
```

3. Move the binary to a directory in your shell's `$PATH`

```bash
sudo mv taq /usr/local/bin
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

We reccomend Windows users run [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and follow the instructions detailed for Linux users

A Windows x86_64 binary is available for those who are interested, however this is entirley unsupported and not reccomended

```shell
curl -LO https://taqueria.io/get/windows/taq.exe
```

## Installing the VS Code Extension


## Installing Taqueria Plugins

Taqueria plugins each implement a specific function such as a smart contract language, testnet, sandbox, or test framework. Taqueria plugins often rely on 3rd party software libraries such as LIGO or Docker which need to be installed on your machine for the plugin to work correctly

Taqueria is designed to be flexible, streamlined, and customizable so plugins are installed on a per-project basis depending on the particular smart contract language, test framework, sandbox environment, and testnet used in the project

Once installed, plugins provide their functionality by exposing tasks in the Taqueria CLI. The tasks available to run on a particular project can be viewed by running the `shell taq --help ` command in a project directory that's using Taqueria
